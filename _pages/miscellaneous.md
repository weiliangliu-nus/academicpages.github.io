I enjoy playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)" target="_blank">Ultimate Frisbee</a> and am currently a member of <a href="https://fissionultimate.weebly.com/community.html" target="_blank">HedonismBots</a>, the developmental division of UChicago's highest level open Ultimate team.</p> 



<p style="margin-top: 1em;">
In 2022, Jianfeng and I co-founded <a href="https://www.instagram.com/novae_ultimatefrisbee_sg?igsh=MTljMGVsM2ljbTRlNA==" target="_blank">Novae</a>, a Singapore-based amateur Ultimate Frisbee team with over 30 players. As a coach, I organized weekly training sessions and competitions to foster teamwork and skill development.

I was also part of the "UChicago Ocean Sunfish" team that won the 2024 Windy City Cup Ultimate Frisbee Championship.
In addition, I competed in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Clf8roCBuEP/?igsh=NjZ1MjIya2szYWU4" target="_blank">2022 Freakshow Work & Play Hat</a> and won a bronze medal. Below is a photo of me playing as a <a href="https://www.theuap.com/ultimate-frisbee-positions-which-one-is-best-for-you" target="_blank">Handler</a> at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq_-1eBBWZv/?igsh=eHF3eW4yanZvcXRk" target="_blank">2023 Singapore Gold & Bold Hat</a>:
