<h2>Ultimate Frisbee</h2>

<p>
I enjoy playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)" target="_blank">Ultimate Frisbee</a>! I am currently a member of <a href="https://fissionultimate.weebly.com/community.html" target="_blank">HedonismBots</a>, the developmental division of UChicago's highest level open Ultimate team.</p> 



<p style="margin-top: 1em;">
In 2022, Jianfeng and I co-founded <a href="https://www.instagram.com/novae_ultimatefrisbee_sg?igsh=MTljMGVsM2ljbTRlNA==" target="_blank">Novae</a>, a Singapore-based amateur Ultimate Frisbee team with over 30 players. As a coach, I organized weekly training sessions and competitions to foster teamwork and skill development.
</p>

<p>
I was also part of the "UChicago Ocean Sunfish" team that won the 2024 Windy City Cup Ultimate Frisbee Championship.
In addition, I competed in the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Clf8roCBuEP/?igsh=NjZ1MjIya2szYWU4" target="_blank">2022 Freakshow Work & Play Hat</a> and won a bronze medal. Below is a photo of me playing as a <a href="https://www.theuap.com/ultimate-frisbee-positions-which-one-is-best-for-you" target="_blank">Handler</a> at the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq_-1eBBWZv/?igsh=eHF3eW4yanZvcXRk" target="_blank">2023 Singapore Gold & Bold Hat</a>:

<h2>Auto Chess</h2>
<p>
I love playing <a href="https://ac.dragonest.com/en/gameIntroduction" target="_blank">Auto Chess</a>, a game that masterfully blends strategy and a touch of luck! 
In each match, eight players draft lineups from a shared pool of chess pieces, carefully managing limited resources to create the best possible synergies.
Players face off in pairs over multiple rounds, with the ultimate goal of being the last one standing. 
</p>

<p>
I’m proud of my average rank of 2.9 among 8 players, with a solid 32% of my games finishing in first place. My best achievement so far is reaching the Queen rank, the highest tier in the game’s ranking system. Below is a screenshot capturing the thrilling final showdown between the last two players, with six others already eliminated.
